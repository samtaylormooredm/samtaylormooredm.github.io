How long did this take (estimate)?
    This lab took me in-class time and around 5 hours outside of class.

What were the enjoyable aspects of the lab?
    I enjoyed the dynamic re-sizing aspect of the scatterplot graph, and I found it 
satisfying to see how the visualization adapted smoothly when switching between 
desktop and mobile views. 

What were the challenging parts of this lab?
    The most challenging part was making sure the SVG container resized correctly and
that all chart elements (like axes and labels) updated with it. It was tricky to keep 
everything aligned correctly.
